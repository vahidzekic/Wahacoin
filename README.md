Creating a full-fledged cryptocurrency like Wahacoin involves a complex codebase including blockchain technology, consensus mechanisms, wallet infrastructure, and more. Below is a simplified example of a basic cryptocurrency using Python. This will not be a production-ready cryptocurrency but will demonstrate fundamental concepts like creating a blockchain, adding transactions, and validating the blockchain.
Basic Structure of Wahacoin

    Block Structure
    Blockchain Structure
    Transaction Mechanism
    Proof of Work

Here's a basic implementation in Python:

python

import hashlib
import time

class Block:
    def __init__(self, index, previous_hash, timestamp, data, nonce=0):
        self.index = index
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.data = data
        self.nonce = nonce
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
        block_string = f"{self.index}{self.previous_hash}{self.timestamp}{self.data}{self.nonce}".encode()
        return hashlib.sha256(block_string).hexdigest()

    def mine_block(self, difficulty):
        target = '0' * difficulty
        while self.hash[:difficulty] != target:
            self.nonce += 1
            self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = [self.create_genesis_block()]
        self.difficulty = 4
        self.pending_transactions = []
        self.mining_reward = 100

    def create_genesis_block(self):
        return Block(0, "0", time.time(), "Genesis Block")

    def get_latest_block(self):
        return self.chain[-1]

    def add_block(self, new_block):
        new_block.previous_hash = self.get_latest_block().hash
        new_block.mine_block(self.difficulty)
        self.chain.append(new_block)

    def is_chain_valid(self):
        for i in range(1, len(self.chain)):
            current_block = self.chain[i]
            previous_block = self.chain[i - 1]

            if current_block.hash != current_block.calculate_hash():
                return False

            if current_block.previous_hash != previous_block.hash:
                return False

        return True

    def create_transaction(self, transaction):
        self.pending_transactions.append(transaction)

    def mine_pending_transactions(self, mining_reward_address):
        block = Block(len(self.chain), self.get_latest_block().hash, time.time(), self.pending_transactions)
        block.mine_block(self.difficulty)

        self.chain.append(block)

        self.pending_transactions = [
            {"from_address": None, "to_address": mining_reward_address, "amount": self.mining_reward}
        ]

class Transaction:
    def __init__(self, from_address, to_address, amount):
        self.from_address = from_address
        self.to_address = to_address
        self.amount = amount

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    wahacoin = Blockchain()

    wahacoin.create_transaction(Transaction("address1", "address2", 50))
    wahacoin.create_transaction(Transaction("address2", "address1", 30))

    print("Starting the miner...")
    wahacoin.mine_pending_transactions("miner_address")

    print("Balance of miner is", wahacoin.pending_transactions[0]['amount'])

    print("Is blockchain valid?", wahacoin.is_chain_valid())
    
    # Print the blockchain
    for block in wahacoin.chain:
        print(f"Index: {block.index}")
        print(f"Previous Hash: {block.previous_hash}")
        print(f"Timestamp: {block.timestamp}")
        print(f"Data: {block.data}")
        print(f"Hash: {block.hash}")
        print(f"Nonce: {block.nonce}")
        print("\n")

Explanation:

    Block Class:
        calculate_hash: Creates a SHA-256 hash of the block's contents.
        mine_block: Mines the block by finding a hash that satisfies the difficulty target.

    Blockchain Class:
        create_genesis_block: Generates the initial block.
        add_block: Adds a new block to the chain.
        is_chain_valid: Validates the integrity of the blockchain.
        create_transaction: Adds a transaction to the list of pending transactions.
        mine_pending_transactions: Mines the pending transactions into a new block.

    Transaction Class:
        Simple class to define a transaction with from_address, to_address, and amount.

This code provides a basic structure for a cryptocurrency. Real-world implementations require additional features such as wallet management, network communication between nodes, advanced consensus mechanisms, and more.
